# CALCULATOR PROJECT 

### Simple Calculator application written in kotlin

### To run the app -> pull the source code, open it in your IDE, and start the Application class.

#### It is not fancy, or full working for that matter. It was build only for learning purposes, and I store it here 
#### simply to not lose it somewhere on some machine. 

#### anyone can pull the source code and continue developing it!! Cheers ðŸ‘‹
