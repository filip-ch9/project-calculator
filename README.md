# CALCULATOR PROJECT 

Simple Calculator application is written in Kotlin
To run the app -> pull the source code, open it in your IDE, and start the Application class.
NOTE -> JavaFX does not work with Java versions later than 1.8. So make sure you use Java 8

It is not fancy, or full working for that matter. It was built only for learning purposes, and I store it here 
simply to not lose it somewhere on some machine. 

Anyone can pull the source code and continue developing it!! Cheers ðŸ‘‹
